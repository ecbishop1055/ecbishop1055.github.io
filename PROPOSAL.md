#Portfolio Proposal

##Description and Motivation
The biggest motivation for this project is to have a place where anyone can see who I am and what I do. This project will show my skills and things I have accomplished as a software developer such as projects and goals I am working towards. This will also be a helpful resource when trying to get job opportunities and showing myself as successful.

##Prior Art
A lot of people use a personal portfolio to show who they are within the software developer space. I took a look into other peoples portfolios and took some inspiration. I really like the simplicity aspect that Ali Spittel has put into hers. All of the information is there but it has a nice little touch showing off her skills in javascript, whenever a user clicks on the blank parts of the page little geometric shapes of pastel colors are randomly generated all over the page. I also favor towards having everything all on one page instead of separated onto different pages. 

##Core User Workflows
* Professional Bio - The site should show a short description(Bio) of who I am and show some of my personality.
* Skills - The user should be able to get an idea of my skills and things im proficient in.
* Goals - There should be a place for a user to see my current goals, long term and short term.
* Contact Info - A place where a user is able to get into contact with me.
* Projects - A user should be able to see some of my projects that I have created to get an idea of what I am capable of.

##Daily Goals
* **Tuesday** - Start getting the general content of my website setup so I can begin design phase. If time allows start adding css
* **Wednesday** - Start adding the design elements to make the website my own and unique. Plus have it look nice and neat.
* **Thursday** - Finish up adding the final design touches and add any extra elements I want. Add things that make my website unique and how I want it.
